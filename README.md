## Auto apply Dead, Unconscious, and Wounded

This automatically applies Wounded condition when a GM-owned token is at or below than half their hit points. It will also automatically apply the Dead or Unconscious condition when a token is at zero hit points.

## Button on Item Cards

This will add an "Add Convenient Effect" button to item cards in chat if there is a convenient effect of the same name. For example, if someone casts the Bless spell, then the button will appear that will apply the Bless effect. This will save you the time of opening the Convenient Effects dialog and searching for the matching effect.

This feature is controlled by a client-level setting, allowing each player to decide whether to show the button or not.
